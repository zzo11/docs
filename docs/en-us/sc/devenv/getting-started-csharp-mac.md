# How to write smart contracts in C# on macOS

### Visual Studio for Mac 

If you already have Visual Studio for Mac installed on your computer, skip this section. Otherwise, download [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/mac/)

Just check the basic functions when installing, without selecting the platform specific components.

### Building NEO smartcontract framework
Unlike on Windows where they can get the `Neo.Smartcontract.Framework` via `NuGet`, on OSX we have to compile it ourselves or step 6 (see below) will fail when using any of the NEO smartcontract specific methods.

Download [neo-devpack-dotnet](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-devpack-dotnet) from GitHub. Open `neo-devpack-dotnet.sln`. You might receive errors about "Unknown solution item type" for the Installer and 2 Template projects, these can be safely ignored. Dismiss the warning dialog and right click on the `Neo.Smartcontract.Framework` project, choose `Build`. Note the location where the `Neo.Smartcontract.Framework.dll` is saved, we will need this location in the next step. i.e.
```
<neo-devpack-dotnet download folder>/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/Neo.SmartContract.Framework.dll.
```

### New Project

Open Visual Studio for Mac，create a new project, and select .NET Standard Library（.NET Core → Library）。

> [!Note]
>
> When you create a new project, select 2.0 for the .NET Core version.

Next, expand the project，right click on `Dependencies` and choose `Edit references...`. Go to the `.NET Assembly` tab, choose `Browse` and add the `Neo.Smartcontract.Framework.dll` from the location saved in Step 2.

Check the checkbox and press ok to close the dialog. Next, write the following sample code in your Class1.cs file.

```c#
using Neo.SmartContract.Framework;
using Neo.SmartContract.Framework.Services.Neo;

public class Class1: SmartContract
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Storage.Put(Storage.CurrentContext, "Hello", "World");
    }
}
```

In the menu choose `Build`，`Build All` to compile the corresponding code. A .dll library file will be created in the folder `bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/`. The .dll is the .NET IL language file that we will feed to the `neo-compiler` later on to convert it to a .avm smart contract file that can be deployed on the blockchain.

In the example the contract is named `sample_contract`. After compilation the file `sample_contract.dll` is created that we'll use in the next section.

### neo-compiler

Download [neo-compiler](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler) from GitHub. Before opening the solution in Visual studio we first have to edit the `neon.csproj` to alter the runtime identifiers. Locate the file at `/neo-compiler/neon/neon.csproj`, open it using a text editor and replace 
```
<RuntimeIdentifiers>win10-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
```
with
```
<RuntimeIdentifiers>osx.10.12-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
```
Next open the `neo-compiler` solution and build the project. You'll now find `neon.dll` under `/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/`.


### .NET Core

Download and install  [.NET Core 2.0.3](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/macos) if you haven't already done so.

### Compiling your smart contract to .avm

The basic syntax is 

```
dotnet neon.dll <your smart contract.dll> --compatible
```

 `neon.dll` is the file from Step 3. In our example `sample_contract.dll` would be our smart contract. The output should look like this

```bash
Eriks-Air:netcoreapp2.0 erik$ dotnet neon.dll ~/Projects/sample_contract/sample_contract/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/sample_contract.dll
Neo.Compiler.MSIL console app v2.0.3.5
Find entrypoint:System.Void Class1::Main()
convert succ
gen abi succ
write:sample_contract.avm
write:sample_contract.abi.json
SUCC
```

You should now find the `.avm` file in the sample_contract output folder
```
Eriks-Air:netcoreapp2.0 erik$ ls -1 ~/Projects/sample_contract/sample_contract/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/
sample_contract.abi.json
sample_contract.avm
sample_contract.deps.json
sample_contract.dll
sample_contract.pdb
```
